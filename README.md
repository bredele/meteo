> Shell command to get the weather based on location


I'm french and living in Calgary Canada since a few months. I realized when I first came how much important it is to know the weather (especially when the temperature nears the -40Â°C!). 

Also I spend most of my time on my command shell and I figured it would be great to get the weather forecast in a simple command line. So here it is.


## Installation

    $ npm install -g meteo

## Usage

Using `meteo` is really simple, just type the following command:

    $ meteo

Here's the different options :
    weather [OPTION]...
    Print the current weather conditions and forecast.
    
    Options:
        -l    Weather location.
